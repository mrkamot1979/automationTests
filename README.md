Automation tests for the CarinderiaOMS system
=======

Overview
-----------
This repo contains basic testing scripts using Java on a simple OMS that I built using PHP/MySQL/Apache (OMS can be found in this account and it is called "CarinderiaOMS") 

Automation technologies used:
   * Selenium Webdriver
   * Java
   * Firepath / Firebug
   
Caveats
-------------
The security aspect of this system is not very good but I did add some input validations as there are a lot of forms in this software.  Before using this software, please make sure to implement safeguards at the MySQL level (i.e. Admin user/password for database, super users, etc...).
